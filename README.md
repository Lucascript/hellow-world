The beginning of a new journey 

Hey, Hi, Hola, Ola... (seja la que lingua voce fala) (whatever language you speak) (no hablo mucho espanol, desculpe?)

I will be writing here in my GITHUB in English because this is my second language and I live in the USA. Born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil currently living in NEW JERSEY, USA. Anyways, I've decided to go back to study coding again after all those years wasted (maybe not, everything happens for a reason) 

I'm 24 years old, married and very very very well married my wife is American so if my english is not good enough you guys know who should've be blamed. 

The first language I studied was Object Pascal - Delphi and then I moved on JAVA AND BELIVE ME OR NOT - I LITE-RA-LLY GAVE UP.(I STILL DON'T KNOW WHY) YOUNG & DUMB I WAS 19yrs 

But now, I consider myself more mature and responsible so now things will be different, I'm starting my journey with a very cool language I've liked very much so far ... console.log('Javascript') 
I know, you are probably like " This is not interesting " I feel you, but remember, always remember. READ MORE...
